# Soccer-Players-Parser
Libraries used: requests, beautifulsoup4, fake-useragent, pandas

A commercial project. 

My task was to parse through the soccer-related website, collect the data about more than 2000 players and present it as a spreadsheet. 
I was given a google-sheet that only contained names. I exported that sheet as a csv-file (data_blank.csv) and used it as a csv as well. After data was collected, i made a pandas DataFrame which was exported to another csv-file (data_filled.csv) afterwards. Then i made a excel-sheet from that csv, using some random online converter, cause i was really short on time. Finally, i presented this excel-sheet to a Client and got my payment.
